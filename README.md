This is a bot that tracks mental health cases on social media platforms



### 1. Use Case Diagram

![Use case diagram](https://github.com/mbuthi/Mental-Health-Bot/blob/main/UML-sys%20design/use-case-diagram-mental-health-bot.png)


The use case diagram outline the following:
- **Configure Monitoring Settings**: System Administrators configure the settings for monitoring social media data.
- **Collect Social Media Data**: Automatically initiated by the bot to collect data from social media platforms.
- **Perform NLP Analysis**: The bot analyzes the collected data using NLP techniques.
- **Generate Insights**: The bot generates insights based on the analysis.
- **View Reports and Insights**: End Users access reports and insights generated by the bot.
- **Update NLP Models**: System Administrators update NLP models to improve analysis accuracy.
- **Manage Data Privacy**: System Administrators enforce data privacy measures.

This diagram illustrates how different classes interact within the system. For example:
- Each `User` can have multiple `SocialMediaPosts`.
- Each `SocialMediaPost` is associated with one `NLPAnalysis`.
- `NLPAnalysis` can contribute to multiple `InsightReports`.
- `DataManager` manages the `SocialMediaPost`s.
- `MonitoringSettings` configure the `DataManager`.
- `PrivacyManager` protects `User` data.

### 3. Sequence Diagram

Creating sequence diagrams will help illustrate how different parts of your mental health insights bot system interact over time to complete specific processes. Let's focus on three key processes to create sequence diagrams for:

1. **Collecting Social Media Data**
2. **Performing NLP Analysis**
3. **Generating and Viewing Insights**

#### a. Collecting Social Media Data

This diagram will show the process of initiating data collection, fetching data from social media, and storing it for analysis.

#### b. Performing NLP Analysis

This diagram illustrates the sequence of events from fetching stored social media data, performing NLP analysis, and storing the analysis results.

#### c. Generating and Viewing Insights

This diagram shows how the system generates insight reports from analyzed data and how an end user views these reports.

### 4. Activity Diagram for Mental Health Insights Bot

The following activity diagram will depict the main activities involved in processing social media data for mental health insights:

1. **Start**: The initiation of the data processing workflow.
2. **Collect Social Media Data**: Fetching posts from social media platforms.
3. **Preprocess Data**: Cleaning and preparing data for analysis.
4. **Perform NLP Analysis**: Analyzing the data with NLP techniques to extract sentiment and identify topics related to mental health.
5. **Generate Insights**: Compiling the analysis results into meaningful insights.
6. **Store Insights**: Saving the insights into a database for future access.
7. **Display Insights to User**: Presenting the insights through a user interface.
8. **End**: The completion of the workflow.

#### Explanation of the Activity Diagram

- **Collect Social Media Data**: This is the first step, where the system interacts with various social media APIs to fetch new posts. It's crucial for providing the raw data needed for analysis.

- **Preprocess Data**: Once data is collected, it undergoes preprocessing. This step includes cleaning the data (removing noise, correcting typos), normalization (standardizing text), and tokenization (breaking text into meaningful units).

- **Perform NLP Analysis**: In this stage, the preprocessed data is analyzed using NLP techniques. The system might perform sentiment analysis to gauge the mood of the posts, topic modeling to identify prevalent mental health issues, and other forms of text analysis relevant to the project's objectives.

- **Generate Insights**: Based on the results from the NLP analysis, the system generates insights. This could involve aggregating data points, identifying trends, and highlighting key areas of concern in mental health discussions on social media.

- **Store Insights**: The generated insights are stored in a database. This storage allows for historical data analysis, trend observation over time, and quick access to recent insights.

- **Display Insights to User**: Finally, the insights are presented to the user through a graphical user interface (GUI) or a report format. This step makes the analysis accessible and understandable to end-users, such as mental health professionals, researchers, or interested individuals.

- **End**: Marks the completion of the process.

This activity diagram provides a clear, step-by-step overview of how the mental health insights bot processes data to generate meaningful insights. By visualizing the system's activities, stakeholders can better understand the workflow and identify areas for improvement or expansion.
