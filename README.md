This diagram illustrates how different classes interact within the system. For example:
- Each `User` can have multiple `SocialMediaPosts`.
- Each `SocialMediaPost` is associated with one `NLPAnalysis`.
- `NLPAnalysis` can contribute to multiple `InsightReports`.
- `DataManager` manages the `SocialMediaPost`s.
- `MonitoringSettings` configure the `DataManager`.
- `PrivacyManager` protects `User` data.

### 3. Sequence Diagram

Creating sequence diagrams will help illustrate how different parts of your mental health insights bot system interact over time to complete specific processes. Let's focus on three key processes to create sequence diagrams for:

1. **Collecting Social Media Data**
2. **Performing NLP Analysis**
3. **Generating and Viewing Insights**

#### a. Collecting Social Media Data

This diagram will show the process of initiating data collection, fetching data from social media, and storing it for analysis.

#### b. Performing NLP Analysis

This diagram illustrates the sequence of events from fetching stored social media data, performing NLP analysis, and storing the analysis results.

#### c. Generating and Viewing Insights

This diagram shows how the system generates insight reports from analyzed data and how an end user views these reports.

### 4. Activity Diagram for Mental Health Insights Bot

The following activity diagram will depict the main activities involved in processing social media data for mental health insights:

1. **Start**: The initiation of the data processing workflow.
2. **Collect Social Media Data**: Fetching posts from social media platforms.
3. **Preprocess Data**: Cleaning and preparing data for analysis.
4. **Perform NLP Analysis**: Analyzing the data with NLP techniques to extract sentiment and identify topics related to mental health.
5. **Generate Insights**: Compiling the analysis results into meaningful insights.
6. **Store Insights**: Saving the insights into a database for future access.
7. **Display Insights to User**: Presenting the insights through a user interface.
8. **End**: The completion of the workflow.

#### Explanation of the Activity Diagram

- **Collect Social Media Data**: This is the first step, where the system interacts with various social media APIs to fetch new posts. It's crucial for providing the raw data needed for analysis.

- **Preprocess Data**: Once data is collected, it undergoes preprocessing. This step includes cleaning the data (removing noise, correcting typos), normalization (standardizing text), and tokenization (breaking text into meaningful units).

- **Perform NLP Analysis**: In this stage, the preprocessed data is analyzed using NLP techniques. The system might perform sentiment analysis to gauge the mood of the posts, topic modeling to identify prevalent mental health issues, and other forms of text analysis relevant to the project's objectives.

- **Generate Insights**: Based on the results from the NLP analysis, the system generates insights. This could involve aggregating data points, identifying trends, and highlighting key areas of concern in mental health discussions on social media.

- **Store Insights**: The generated insights are stored in a database. This storage allows for historical data analysis, trend observation over time, and quick access to recent insights.

- **Display Insights to User**: Finally, the insights are presented to the user through a graphical user interface (GUI) or a report format. This step makes the analysis accessible and understandable to end-users, such as mental health professionals, researchers, or interested individuals.

- **End**: Marks the completion of the process.

### 5. Component Diagram for Mental Health Insights Bot

The component diagram will focus on the system's software components and their relationships. Essential components include the Data Collection Module, NLP Analysis Engine, Database, Insight Generation Module, and User Interface.

![Component diagram](https://github.com/mbuthi/Mental-Health-Bot/blob/main/UML-sys%20design/component-diagram.png)

### Explanation of the Component Diagram

- **Data Collection Module (DCM)**: Responsible for fetching social media posts from various platforms via APIs. It sends collected data to the Database for storage.
- **NLP Analysis Engine (NLP)**: Analyzes the textual content from social media posts stored in the Database, using natural language processing techniques to identify sentiments, topics, and trends related to mental health.
- **Database (DB)**: Stores both the raw social media posts fetched by the DCM and the analysis results produced by the NLP Analysis Engine. It acts as a central repository accessible by other components.
- **Insight Generation Module (IGM)**: Processes the analyzed data to generate actionable insights, such as identifying prevalent mental health issues or tracking sentiment trends over time.
- **User Interface (UI)**: The front-end component through which users interact with the system, view insights, and configure settings.

### Deployment Diagram for Mental Health Insights Bot

The deployment diagram will outline how the system's components are deployed across servers or cloud infrastructure.

### Explanation of the Deployment Diagram

- **Web Server**: Hosts the User Interface and the Insight Generation Module, facilitating user interaction and the presentation of insights. Users access the system through the UI, which communicates with the Insight Generation Module to display insights.
- **Application Server**: Runs the Data Collection Module and the NLP Analysis Engine. It is responsible for the heavy lifting of data collection and analysis. The Application Server interacts closely with the Database Server to store and retrieve data.
- **Database Server**: A dedicated server for hosting the Database. It stores all data collected by the Data Collection Module and the analysis results generated by the NLP Analysis Engine. Both the Application Server and the Web Server access the Database Server for data storage and retrieval.
